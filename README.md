## Overview

BioVerse is an all-in-one, AI-powered health ecosystem designed to unify Africa's fragmented healthcare landscape. It moves beyond reactive treatment to deliver proactive, predictive, and personalized care through the concept of a **Living Digital Twin**.

Each person is represented by a dynamic, continuously learning digital twin that models the complex interplay between their biology, genetics, lifestyle, and environment. These individual twins are then interconnected within a larger network, creating living models of families, communities, and entire populations. This multi-scale approach allows BioVerse to not only deliver personalized wellness nudges but also to identify and predict large-scale health trends, resource needs, and disease outbreaks.

## The Vision: A Unified, Proactive Health Ecosystem

Our vision is to build the single platform that coordinates healthcare across Africa, replacing dozens of fragmented systems with one intelligent, cohesive whole.

- **Unified Platform:** One system to manage all aspects of health, from individual patient care and telehealth to population-level analytics and pandemic response.
- **Living Digital Twins:** A virtual, dynamic representation of every person, enabling truly personalized medicine and proactive interventions before illness occurs.
- **Quantum-Inspired Network:** We use a revolutionary modeling framework inspired by quantum principles. Concepts like "entanglement" are used to model the deep, interconnected health dependencies between people, while "superposition" helps us manage the inherent uncertainties of biology. This allows for unprecedented accuracy in predicting both individual and collective health outcomes.
- **Population-Scale Proaction:** By aggregating insights from the entire network, we can predict and respond to disease outbreaks, optimize resource allocation for Ministries of Health, and ultimately elevate the wellbeing of entire nations.
- **Africa-Ready by Design:** Engineered for the African context with offline-first capabilities, multi-lingual support (including SMS/USSD), and optimization for low-bandwidth environments.

## Tech Stack
- **Web Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, i18n.
- **Mobile App**: Expo React Native for cross-platform support.
- **Server/API**: Node.js + Express, PostgreSQL, Redis for core backend services.
- **AI Service**: A high-performance Python service using FastAPI, responsible for:
    - **Digital Twin Core**: Manages the state and logic of each Living Patient Twin.
    - **Machine Learning**: Foundational risk and trajectory models using Scikit-learn.
    - **Advanced Predictions**: Multi-modal forecasting (genomics, lifestyle) for life expectancy and quality of life.
    - **Conversational AI**: LLM-based interactive health companion via Ollama.
    - **Medical Vision**: CNN-based analysis of medical images (X-rays, dermatology, etc.).
    - **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving model training across a network of participants.
- **DevOps & Infra**: Docker, Docker Compose, Terraform, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
