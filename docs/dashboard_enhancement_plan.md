# Dashboard Enhancement Plan for BioVerse

This document outlines a phased approach to enhance the Admin and Ministry of Health (MoH) dashboards in the BioVerse application, transforming them into powerful tools for oversight, strategic planning, and public health management.

## Phase 1: Immediate Enhancements (Data Visualization & Basic Actions)

1.  **Populate `AdminDashboard.tsx` with Real Data & Visualizations:**
    *   **Recent Activity Feed:** Implement a dynamic feed showing recent patient registrations, new symptom checks, appointment bookings, and critical alerts. This would involve fetching data from relevant tables (patients, symptomChecks, appointments) with timestamps.
    *   **Quick Actions:** Add buttons or links for common administrative tasks, such as:
        *   "Manage Users" (link to a user management page)
        *   "View All Patients" (link to patient list)
        *   "Add New Patient" (link to patient registration form)
        *   "Generate Report" (trigger a report generation process).
    *   **Enhanced Statistics:**
        *   Break down `totalSymptoms` by common symptom types (e.g., "Fever," "Cough").
        *   Show trends for `totalPatients`, `totalAppointments`, `totalSymptoms` over time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly graphs).
        *   Visualize `highRiskAlerts` by location or type.
    *   *Backend Impact:* New API endpoints in `dashboardController.js` to fetch recent activities, symptom breakdowns, and time-series data.

2.  **Develop Core `MinistryDashboard.tsx` Features:**
    *   **National Health Overview:** Display aggregated national statistics beyond just counts. This could include:
        *   Disease prevalence (from symptom checks and diagnoses).
        *   Geographical distribution of health issues (using location data from patients and symptom checks).
        *   Resource utilization (e.g., number of appointments per health worker, lab test volumes).
        *   Maternal health statistics (e.g., number of pregnancies registered, maternal mortality rates if available).
    *   **Policy Impact Monitoring:** If policies are implemented through the system, show metrics related to their adoption and and effectiveness.
    *   **System Performance Metrics:** Display uptime, response times, and user activity to monitor the system's health.
    *   *Backend Impact:* Significant new API endpoints in `dashboardController.js` and potentially new controllers for specific data aggregations (e.g., `nationalHealthController.js`).

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (AI Integration & Strategic Tools)

3.  **AI-Powered Insights & Predictive Analytics:**
    *   **Predictive Outbreak Maps:** Integrate the `getSymptomTrends` data from `symptomController.js` to visualize potential disease outbreaks on a map, allowing the MoH to proactively allocate resources.
    *   **Resource Demand Forecasting:** Use AI to predict future demand for medical supplies, personnel, and facilities based on historical data and current trends.
    *   **Personalized Health Interventions (Aggregated):** While individual interventions are for patients, the MoH dashboard could show the *impact* of these interventions at a population level.
    *   *Backend Impact:* Leverage existing AI services and potentially develop new ones for higher-level predictive models.

4.  **User and Role Management (Admin):**
    *   **CRUD Operations for Users:** Allow administrators to create, read, update, and delete user accounts.
    *   **Role Assignment:** Enable admins to assign and modify user roles (patient, health_worker, admin, moh, pharmacy).
    *   **Audit Logs:** Display a log of administrative actions for accountability.
    *   *Backend Impact:* New `userController.js` with secure endpoints for user management.

5.  **Reporting and Exporting Capabilities:**
    *   Allow both Admin and MoH users to generate and export detailed reports (e.g., CSV, PDF) on various health metrics, patient demographics, and system performance.
    *   *Backend Impact:* New endpoints for report generation, potentially using a dedicated reporting service.

## Phase 3: Strategic & Collaborative Tools

6.  **Policy Management (MoH):**
    *   A dedicated section for MoH to view, draft, and publish health policies or guidelines that can be disseminated through the BioVerse system.
    *   *Backend Impact:* New `policyController.js` and associated database tables.

7.  **Communication & Alerting (MoH & Admin):**
    *   System-wide announcement features for critical health advisories or system updates.
    *   Targeted alerts to specific user groups (e.g., health workers in a particular region).
    *   *Backend Impact:* New messaging/notification service.
